# Project 1: Voice Recognition with Arduino

## Description
This project explores the use of TinyML for voice recognition using an Arduino board (Arduino Nano BLE Sense) and a microphone.

### Project Plan:
- Collect voice data using Arduino and an external microphone.
- Preprocess the audio data and convert it into a format suitable for TinyML.
- Train a TinyML model to recognize basic voice commands.

### Tools:
- Arduino Nano BLE Sense
- TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
- Audacity for recording audio samples

### Next Steps:
1. Set up the environment and prepare datasets.
2. Build and train the model.
3. Deploy the model to the Arduino board.
